## Introduction
A stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the stack operations are performed. The order of operations is normally described as First In Last Out or Last In First Out. 

A stack works in a similar way as a stack of papers. for this example the rule will be that a person can only place a paper or remove a paper from the top of the stack. If a person wants to go through this stack of papers they must pull (pop operation) one paper at a time from the top of the pile to get through all the papers. If a person wants to add (push operation) a paper to the stack they have to place the paper on the top of the pile. The bottom paper (front of the stack) was the first paper to be placed in the pile. The top paper (back of the stack) was the last to be placed.

## Uses of Stack

## Performance
Here are some of the common stack operations and how fast they are if the stack is using a dynanmic array to make the stack.
| Stack Operations | Description                                               | Performance |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| push(value)      | Pushes the value on to the back of the stack.             | O(1)        |
| pop()            | Removes or pops the last item from the back of the stack. | O(1)        |
| size()           | Returns the size of the stack.                            | O(1)        |
| empty()          | Returns true or false if the length of the stack in zero. | O(1)        |
