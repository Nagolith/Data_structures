**Data Structures**

Welcome to this little guide to some of the data structures that are out there. Here are the data structures that will be covered:

- [Stacks](stack.md)
- [Linked List](linked_list.md)
- [Trees](trees.md)

Each topic will contain some descriptions, provide an example, and have a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
